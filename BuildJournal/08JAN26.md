## Phase 0: Project Setup & Environment Configuration

**Date:** January 8, 2026  
**Time:** ~18:50 PST

### Step 1: Initialize Expo Project with TypeScript Template
**Time:** 18:48 PST

**Action:** Manually created Expo project structure since `create-expo-app` couldn't initialize in a non-empty directory.

**Files Created:**
- `package.json` - Project configuration with Expo SDK 51 dependencies
- `app.json` - Expo app configuration with camera permissions for iOS and Android
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration with path aliases (`@/*` → `src/*`)
- `babel.config.js` - Babel configuration with Reanimated plugin
- `App.tsx` - Main app entry point
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore patterns for Expo/React Native projects
- `app.config.js` - Dynamic Expo config

**Reason:** The `create-expo-app` command requires an empty directory, but we already had `ROADMAP.md` and `BuildJournal.md`. Instead of moving files around, we manually created the essential Expo project files to have full control over the setup.

**Camera Permissions Configured:**
- iOS: `NSCameraUsageDescription` and `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` in `app.json`
- Android: `CAMERA` and `RECORD_AUDIO` permissions
- Expo Camera plugin configured with permission message

### Step 2: Install Core Dependencies
**Time:** 18:49 PST

**Action:** Installed all core dependencies from Phase 0 requirements.

**Dependencies Installed:**
1. **Expo Core:**
   - `expo-camera@~15.0.16` - Camera access for pose detection
   - `expo-gl@~14.0.2` - WebGL for TensorFlow.js
   - `expo-gl-cpp@^11.4.0` - C++ bindings for expo-gl
   - `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage@1.23.1` - Local storage

2. **TensorFlow.js:**
   - `@tensorflow/tfjs@^4.22.0` - Core TensorFlow.js library
   - `@tensorflow/tfjs-react-native@^1.0.0` - React Native bindings
   - **Note:** Installed with `--legacy-peer-deps` due to version conflict (tfjs-react-native requires expo-camera@^13.4.4, but we're using SDK 51 with expo-camera@15.0.16)

3. **State Management & Storage:**
   - `zustand@^5.0.9` - Lightweight state management
   - `expo-sqlite@~14.0.6` - Local SQLite database

4. **UX Enhancements:**
   - `expo-haptics@~13.0.1` - Haptic feedback
   - `expo-av@~14.0.7` - Audio/video playback

5. **Animation & Gestures:**
   - `react-native-reanimated@~3.10.1` - Smooth animations
   - `react-native-gesture-handler@~2.16.1` - Gesture handling

6. **Navigation:**
   - `@react-navigation/native@^7.1.26` - Core navigation library
   - `@react-navigation/native-stack@^7.9.0` - Stack navigator
   - `react-native-screens@^4.19.0` - Native screen components
   - `react-native-safe-area-context@^5.6.2` - Safe area handling

**Reason:** All dependencies are required for Phase 1 (pose detection) and future phases. Installed them upfront to verify compatibility and resolve any version conflicts early.

**Issues Encountered:**
- TensorFlow.js React Native has a peer dependency conflict with expo-camera versions. Used `--legacy-peer-deps` to resolve. This is a known issue and shouldn't affect functionality.
- React Navigation required updating react-native-screens to v4.x for compatibility.

### Step 3: Set Up Project Folder Structure
**Time:** 18:49 PST

**Action:** Created organized folder structure as specified in roadmap.

**Structure Created:**
```
src/
├── screens/     - Screen components
├── components/  - Reusable UI components
├── services/    - Business logic (pose detection, form analysis)
├── utils/       - Utility functions (angle calculations, etc.)
├── stores/      - Zustand state stores
├── types/       - TypeScript type definitions
└── constants/   - App constants
```

**Files Created:**
- `src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx` - Basic home screen component

**Reason:** Organized structure makes the codebase maintainable and follows React Native best practices. Separates concerns (UI, business logic, state, types).

### Step 4: Configure TypeScript Path Aliases
**Time:** 18:48 PST (configured in tsconfig.json)

**Action:** Set up path aliases in `tsconfig.json` for cleaner imports.

**Configuration:**
```json
"baseUrl": ".",
"paths": {
  "@/*": ["src/*"]
}
```

**Reason:** Allows imports like `import HomeScreen from '@/screens/HomeScreen'` instead of relative paths like `'../../screens/HomeScreen'`. Improves code readability and makes refactoring easier.

### Step 5: Create Basic Navigation Structure
**Time:** 18:50 PST

**Action:** Set up React Navigation with a basic stack navigator.

**Files Modified:**
- `App.tsx` - Updated to use NavigationContainer and Stack Navigator
- `src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx` - Created initial home screen

**Navigation Setup:**
- Using `@react-navigation/native` with `createNativeStackNavigator`
- Initial route: "Home"
- Header hidden for now (will customize per screen later)

**Reason:** Navigation is essential for multi-screen app. Setting it up early allows us to easily add new screens (CameraScreen, HistoryScreen, etc.) in future phases.

### Step 6: Initialize Git Repository
**Time:** 18:50 PST

**Action:** Initialized git repository (was already initialized, reinitialized to ensure proper setup).

**Files:**
- `.gitignore` already configured to exclude:
  - `node_modules/`
  - `.expo/`
  - Build artifacts
  - OS-specific files (`.DS_Store`)

**Reason:** Version control is essential for tracking progress, especially with incremental commits as specified in the roadmap. Git allows us to roll back if needed and track changes through each phase.

### Step 7: Fix Package.json Entry Point
**Time:** 18:50 PST

**Action:** Changed `main` field from `"expo-router/entry"` to `"node_modules/expo/AppEntry.js"`.

**Reason:** We're using React Navigation, not Expo Router. The entry point needs to match our setup.

## Phase 0 Update: Upgrade to Expo SDK 54

**Date:** January 8, 2026  
**Time:** ~19:17 PST

### Issue Encountered
**Time:** 19:16 PST

**Problem:** Expo Go app on physical device is SDK 54, but project was initialized with SDK 51, causing incompatibility error:
```
ERROR  Project is incompatible with this version of Expo Go
• The installed version of Expo Go is for SDK 54.0.0.
• The project you opened uses SDK 51.
```

**Reason for Upgrade:** Testing on a real device is critical for camera and ML features (as emphasized in the roadmap). The Expo Go app on the user's phone is SDK 54, so we must upgrade the project to match.

### Upgrade Process
**Time:** 19:16-19:17 PST

**Actions Taken:**
1. Upgraded Expo core: `expo@~51.0.0` → `expo@~54.0.0`
2. Upgraded all Expo packages to SDK 54 compatible versions:
   - `expo-camera`: `~15.0.16` → `^17.0.10`
   - `expo-gl`: `~14.0.2` → `^16.0.9`
   - `expo-av`: `~14.0.7` → `^16.0.8`
   - `expo-haptics`: `~13.0.1` → `^15.0.8`
   - `expo-sqlite`: `~14.0.6` → `^16.0.10`
   - `expo-status-bar`: `~1.12.1` → `^3.0.9`
   - `react-native-reanimated`: `~3.10.1` → `^4.2.1`
   - `react-native-gesture-handler`: `~2.16.1` → `^2.30.0`
   - `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`: `1.23.1` → `^2.2.0`
3. Upgraded React and React Native:
   - `react`: `18.2.0` → `^19.1.0` (SDK 54 requirement)
   - `react-native`: `0.74.5` → `^0.81.5` (SDK 54 requirement)

**Installation Method:** Used `--legacy-peer-deps` flag for all installations due to TensorFlow.js React Native peer dependency conflicts. This is expected and documented.

**Files Modified:**
- `package.json` - All dependencies updated to SDK 54 compatible versions

**Verification:**
- All packages successfully installed
- Project structure remains intact
- No breaking changes to existing code (App.tsx, HomeScreen.tsx still compatible)

**Result:**
✅ Project is now compatible with Expo SDK 54 and should work with Expo Go app on physical device.

**Next Steps:**
- Test app startup: `npm start` or `npx expo start`
- Verify app loads on physical device with Expo Go
- Proceed to Phase 1: Pose Detection Foundation

- `@types/react@19.2.7` - expected version: `~19.1.10`
- `typescript@5.3.3` - expected version: `~5.9.2`

**Problem 2:** Babel bundling error:
```
ERROR  Error: [BABEL]: Cannot find module 'react-native-worklets/plugin'
```

**Root Cause:** 
- Packages were installed with `latest` versions instead of Expo SDK 54 compatible versions
- `react-native-reanimated@~4.1.1` requires `react-native-worklets` as a peer dependency, but it wasn't installed

### Fixes Applied
**Time:** 19:21-19:22 PST

**Actions Taken:**
1. Downgraded packages to Expo SDK 54 compatible versions:
   - `react-native-gesture-handler`: `^2.30.0` → `~2.28.0`
   - `react-native-reanimated`: `^4.2.1` → `~4.1.1`
   - `@types/react`: `^19.2.7` → `~19.1.10`
   - `typescript`: `~5.3.3` → `~5.9.2`

2. Installed missing dependency:
   - `react-native-worklets@^0.7.1` - Required by react-native-reanimated for Babel plugin

**Installation Method:** Used `npm install` with `--legacy-peer-deps` flag due to TensorFlow.js React Native peer dependency conflicts.

**Files Modified:**
- `package.json` - Package versions updated to match Expo SDK 54 requirements

**Verification:**
- All packages successfully installed
- `babel.config.js` already correctly configured with `react-native-reanimated/plugin`
- No linting errors

**Result:**
✅ Package versions now match Expo SDK 54 requirements
✅ Missing `react-native-worklets` dependency installed
✅ Babel should now be able to find the required plugin

**Next Steps:**
- Test app startup: `npm start` or `npx expo start`
- Verify bundling works without errors
- Test on physical device with Expo Go

## Phase 0 Update: Fix Runtime Type Error

**Date:** January 8, 2026  
**Time:** ~19:31 PST

### Issue Encountered
**Time:** 19:30 PST

**Problem:** Runtime error when launching app on physical device:
```
ERROR  [Error: Exception in HostFunction: TypeError: expected dynamic type 'boolean', but had type 'string']
```

**Root Cause:** 
- `react-native-screens` and `react-native-safe-area-context` were using incompatible versions (excluded from Expo validation)
- These packages need to match Expo SDK 54 requirements for proper React Native bridge communication
- The type error suggests a prop type mismatch in native modules, likely from version incompatibility

### Fixes Applied
**Time:** 19:30-19:31 PST

**Actions Taken:**
1. Updated navigation-related packages to Expo SDK 54 compatible versions:
   - `react-native-safe-area-context`: `^5.6.2` → `~5.6.0` (SDK 54 compatible)
   - `react-native-screens`: `^4.19.0` → `~4.16.0` (SDK 54 compatible)

2. Removed package exclusions from `package.json`:
   - Removed `react-native-screens` and `react-native-safe-area-context` from `expo.install.exclude`
   - Allows Expo to properly manage these dependencies

3. Updated `App.tsx` structure:
   - Changed from Fragment (`<>`) to `View` wrapper (better compatibility with React 19)
   - Removed `style="auto"` prop from StatusBar (using default behavior)
   - Wrapped StatusBar and NavigationContainer in a View with `flex: 1`

**Files Modified:**
- `package.json` - Updated package versions, removed exclusions
- `App.tsx` - Changed wrapper structure and StatusBar usage

**Installation Method:** Used `npm install` with `--legacy-peer-deps` flag due to TensorFlow.js React Native peer dependency conflicts.

**Verification:**
- Packages successfully updated
- No linting errors
- App structure is cleaner and more compatible

**Result:**
✅ Navigation packages now match Expo SDK 54 requirements
✅ App structure updated for better React 19 compatibility
✅ Type error should be resolved

**Next Steps:**
- Test app startup: `npm start` or `npx expo start`
- Verify app loads on physical device without runtime errors
- Proceed to Phase 1: Pose Detection Foundation once confirmed working
