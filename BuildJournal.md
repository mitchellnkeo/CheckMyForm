# Build Journal Index

This directory contains daily build journal entries organized by date.

## File Naming Convention

Journal files are named using the format: `DDMMMYY.md`
- `DD` = Day (01-31)
- `MMM` = Month abbreviation (JAN, FEB, MAR, etc.)
- `YY` = Year (26, 27, etc.)

Example: `08JAN26.md` for January 8, 2026

## Journal Entries
